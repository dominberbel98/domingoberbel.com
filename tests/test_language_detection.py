"""The answer language must follow the visitor, not the corpus.

Two defects put English speakers into Spanish answers in production:

1. `detect_language` counted markers from a closed ~37-word English list and
   resolved ties with `english > spanish`, so any English question built from
   words outside that list scored 0-0 and fell through to Spanish. "Give me a
   summary" and "Salary expectations?" are ordinary recruiter questions with
   not one word in the list.

2. A single accented character forced Spanish. Domingo's history is full of
   Spanish place names, so "Has he worked in Almería?" — English by every other
   measure — was answered in Spanish because of the í in a proper noun.

The frontend also sends the site's language switch, but that is what the visitor
reads the site in, not what they ask in, so it only decides questions with no
language of their own. These tests pin the heuristic and that precedence.
