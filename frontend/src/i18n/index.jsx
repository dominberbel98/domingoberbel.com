/**
 * One language for the whole site.
 *
 * Still no i18n library. Two languages and a flat dictionary do not justify one,
 * and the tests that keep the trees honest live in Python next to the rest of
 * the frontend guards.
 *
 * The important consequence of doing it this way: **the dictionary must be read
 * during render, not at import time.** Several components used to capture it in
 * a module-level constant — `NAV_ITEMS`, `SLIDER_FIELDS`, the tab arrays,
 * `const L = tr.laliga` — which was harmless while there was one language and
 * silently unfixable once there were two, because the labels would freeze at
 * whatever was loaded first. Those all moved inside their components.
 *
 * English is the default on a first visit regardless of browser locale: it is
 * what a recruiter sees, and the corpus the assistant answers from is English.
 * The choice is one tap and is remembered.
